## Exoplanet detection
### What is an exoplanet?
An exoplanet is any planet beyond our solar system. Most orbit other stars, but free-floating exoplanets, called rogue planets, orbit the galactic center and are untethered to any star.
We know from NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope that there are more planets than stars in the galaxy.
The first exoplanets were discovered in the 1990s and since then we’ve identified thousands using a variety of detection methods-- measuring the dimming of a star that happens to have a planet pass in front of it, called the transit method.
our dataset is also recorded data of NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope.
